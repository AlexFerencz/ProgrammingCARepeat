For this please have a Git bash (https://git-scm.com/downloads) downloaded and OWASP ZAP (https://www.zaproxy.org/download/) downloaded on your machine. You also need a code editing software, I personally used IntelliJ IDEA Community edition, but feel free to use whatever you have. Download the ZIP and open the Command Prompt or Git and cycle to the secure or insecure version. Once in that specific folder type "node app.js" then you can access the simple form using http://localhost:3000 for the insecure version, and https://localhost:3000 for the secure version.
